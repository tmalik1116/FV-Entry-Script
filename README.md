# FV-Entry-Script

Modified Python script for automation of adding deficiencies to Field View V3.0

V1.0 read Excel data from a .csv file and required more logic in order to convert a task to its subtrade,
and for correctly identifying and selecting the location of the deficiency within the building based on its description.

This version reads from a .txt file  or csv file and has a larger library of subtrades.
This version is meant for use with the site visit reports, more easily transferring them to FV.

This is not a plug and play solution, it was designed to work with my specific computer setup. However it can be adapted 
quite easily to be much more broadly applicable.
